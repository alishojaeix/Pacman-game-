# Pac-Man Game in Python

A classic Pac-Man game implementation using Python and Pygame. This project recreates the iconic arcade game with all its essential features, including the maze, dots, power pellets, ghosts with different behaviors, and the original game mechanics.

## Features

- **Authentic Gameplay**: Faithful recreation of the original Pac-Man mechanics
- **Visual Options**: Uses online images for characters or falls back to simple shapes
- **Ghost AI**: Each ghost has its own unique behavior pattern (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde)
- **Power Pellets**: Temporarily turn ghosts vulnerable
- **Score System**: Track your progress with a scoring system
- **Lives System**: Standard 3-life system with game over screen

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Pygame
- Requests (for online images)
- Pillow (for image processing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pacman-python.git
   cd pacman-python
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Play

- Use arrow keys to move Pac-Man
- Eat all the dots to advance
- Power pellets make ghosts vulnerable for a short time
- Avoid ghosts unless they're vulnerable
- Press 'P' to pause the game
- Press 'R' to restart after game over

## Customization

You can easily customize:
- Game speed
